# 🚨 SECURITY NOTICE 🚨
# This file previously contained exposed production secrets and has been sanitized.
# 
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: All secrets that were in this file have been compromised and should be:
# 1. Immediately rotated/regenerated in their respective services
# 2. Never committed to version control again
# 
# 📁 For production deployment, use these files instead:
# - `env.production.example` - Template for environment variables
# - `vercel-setup.sh` - Script to configure Vercel environment variables
# - Follow the setup instructions in README.md

## 🔄 Required Actions:

### 1. Rotate Compromised Keys
The following services had exposed keys and need immediate rotation:
- **Database**: Regenerate Supabase anon key and service role key in Supabase dashboard
- **Authentication**: Regenerate any authentication service keys in your provider's dashboard
- **Any other services**: Check for any additional exposed credentials

### 2. Setup Production Environment
```bash
# 1. Copy the environment template
cp env.production.example .env.production

# 2. Fill in your NEW (rotated) credentials in .env.production
# 3. Run the Vercel setup script
./vercel-setup.sh

# 4. Verify deployment works with new credentials
```

### 3. Security Best Practices Going Forward
- ✅ Never commit actual secrets to version control
- ✅ Use environment variables or secure vaults for secrets
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Use different keys for development and production
- ✅ Monitor for accidental secret exposure

## 📋 Original Configuration (Sanitized)
The original file contained environment variables for:
- Authentication (NextAuth and other auth providers)
- Database (Supabase)
- Caching (Redis/Upstash)  
- Rate limiting
- Admin configuration
- Site URLs and redirects

All actual values have been moved to secure templates and setup scripts.

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Session Management (`/app/api/auth/sessions/route.ts`)
- `GET` - Retrieve user's active sessions with device information
- `POST` - Create new session (session refresh)
- `PUT` - Update session activity (heartbeat)
- `DELETE` - Invalidate all user sessions

#### Session Invalidation (`/app/api/auth/sessions/invalidate/route.ts`)
- `POST` - Trigger invalidation (direct or rule-based)
- `GET` - Retrieve invalidation history and pending actions
- `PUT` - Modify pending invalidations (cancel, delay, execute)
- `DELETE` - Clear invalidation history (admin only)

#### Device Management (`/app/api/auth/sessions/devices/route.ts`)
- `GET` - Retrieve user devices with session information
- `POST` - Register new device
- `PUT` - Update device (trust, verify, deactivate)
- `DELETE` - Remove device and invalidate sessions

### 5. React Integration (`/hooks/useSessionManager.ts`)
Custom React hook providing:
- Session monitoring and management
- Device trust operations
- Real-time invalidation alerts
- Automatic session heartbeat
- Security event handling
- User-friendly session control interface

### 6. Database Schema (`/supabase/migrations/20250917000001_session_management_system.sql`)

**New Tables:**
- `user_sessions` - Session tracking with versioning
- `user_devices` - Device registration and trust management
- `session_invalidation_events` - Audit trail for invalidations
- `device_verification_requests` - Device verification workflow
- `graceful_invalidation_schedule` - Scheduled invalidations
- `user_notifications` - Security notifications
- `security_events` - Comprehensive security logging

**Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic triggers for logging
- Cleanup functions for maintenance
- Performance optimized indexes
- Complete audit trails

## Enhanced Authentication Integration

### Updated WorkOS Callback (`/app/api/auth/workos/callback/route.ts`)
- Integrated session creation with version management
- Automatic device registration during login
- Enhanced security logging
- Graceful fallback for session management failures

### Enhanced Auth Middleware (`/lib/auth-middleware.ts`)
- Session version validation
- Automatic session activity updates
- Enhanced security event logging
- Support for both legacy and versioned sessions

### Enhanced Auth Context (`/contexts/WorkOSAuthContext.tsx`)
- Real-time security alert system
- Session invalidation functions
- Security event monitoring
- Graceful invalidation handling
- User notification management

## Security Features

### 1. Automatic Invalidation Triggers
- **Password Change**: Invalidates all sessions except current
- **Security Breach**: Immediate invalidation of all sessions
- **Suspicious Activity**: Selective session termination
- **Admin Action**: Manual session termination
- **Device Change**: Invalidates sessions from old devices
- **Location Change**: Geographic-based invalidation
- **Permission Change**: Invalidates sessions with outdated permissions

### 2. Graceful Invalidation
- 5-minute warning before forced logout
- User can cancel or delay invalidation
- Custom messages based on invalidation reason
- Emergency immediate execution option

### 3. Device Security
- New device verification requirement
- Trust duration with automatic expiration
- Maximum 10 trusted devices per user
- Suspicious device detection
- Automatic device deactivation

### 4. Session Analytics
- Usage pattern monitoring
- Security metrics collection
- Audit trail for all actions
- Performance monitoring
- Compliance reporting

## User Experience Features

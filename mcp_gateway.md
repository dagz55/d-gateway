### **1. Connect to the MCP Gateway** 🔌

  Since the MCP interface shows "No MCP servers configured," Claude Code needs to connect to our MCP gateway:

  ```bash
  # First, ensure the MCP gateway is running
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d

  # Then connect to the filesystem service
  /mcp connect filesystem http://localhost:8080/mcp/filesystem
  ```

  ### **2. Verify MCP Connection** ✅

  Once connected, Claude Code should verify the connection:

  ```bash
  # Check available tools
  /mcp list tools

  # Test filesystem access
  /mcp call filesystem read_text_file --path "app/globals.css"
  ```

  ### **3. Use MCP Tools for Development** 🛠️

  Claude Code can now leverage the same powerful tools:

  #### **File Operations**
  ```bash
  # Read project files
  /mcp call filesystem read_text_file --path "package.json"

  # Search for specific patterns
  /mcp call filesystem search_files --path "." --pattern "*.tsx"
  ```

  #### **Database Operations**
  ```bash
  # Connect to Supabase service
  /mcp connect supabase http://localhost:8080/mcp/supabase

  # Query database
  /mcp call supabase query --sql "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles"
  ```

  #### **Component Analysis**
  ```bash
  # Connect to ReactBits service
  /mcp connect reactbits http://localhost:8080/mcp/reactbits

  # Analyze components
  /mcp call reactbits analyze_component --path "components/layout/Sidebar.tsx"
  ```

  ### **4. Follow the Updated Documentation** 📚

  Claude Code should reference the updated `CLAUDE.md` which now includes:

  - **Complete MCP Integration Guide**: All 6 services documented
  - **Recent Changes**: v2.11.14 with all latest features
  - **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
  - **Environment Setup**: Vercel deployment configuration
  - **Development Workflow**: Best practices and patterns

  ### **5. Key MCP Services to Connect** 🔗

  Based on our setup, Claude Code should connect to these services:

  1. **Filesystem** (`http://localhost:8080/mcp/filesystem`)
     - File operations, CSS analysis, code inspection

  2. **Supabase** (`http://localhost:8080/mcp/supabase`)
     - Database queries, user management

  3. **Memory** (`http://localhost:8080/mcp/memory`)
     - Data caching, session management

  4. **ReactBits** (`http://localhost:8080/mcp/reactbits`)
     - Component analysis and optimization

  ### **6. Development Tasks Claude Code Can Now Handle** 🎯

  With MCP access, Claude Code can:

  - **Analyze CSS Issues**: Use filesystem service to inspect `app/globals.css`
  - **Debug Database Problems**: Query Supabase directly for user profile issues
  - **Optimize Components**: Use ReactBits to analyze and improve React components
  - **File Management**: Read, edit, and search project files efficiently
  - **Environment Validation**: Check configuration and troubleshoot deployment issues

  ### **7. Quick Start Commands** ⚡

  Claude Code should run these commands to get started:

  ```bash
  # Start MCP gateway
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d

  # Connect to filesystem service
  /mcp connect filesystem http://localhost:8080/mcp/filesystem

  # Verify connection
  /mcp call filesystem list_directory --path "/app"

  # Read project documentation
  /mcp call filesystem read_text_file --path "CLAUDE.md"
  ```

  ### **8. Reference Documentation** ��

  Claude Code should also check these files we created:

  - **`KILO_CODE_MCP_PROMPT.md`**: Detailed MCP integration guide
  - **`KILO_CODE_QUICK_START.md`**: Quick start commands
  - **`VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`**: Deployment troubleshooting
  - **`CLAUDE.md`**: Complete development guide

  ## 🎯 Expected Outcome

  Once Claude Code connects to the MCP gateway, it will have access to the same powerful tools and can:

  1. **Debug Issues**: Use filesystem service to analyze code problems
  2. **Manage Database**: Query and update Supabase data directly
  3. **Optimize Components**: Use ReactBits for component analysis
  4. **Automate Tasks**: Use Puppeteer for browser automation
  5. **Search Documentation**: Use Context7 for knowledge retrieval

  The MCP gateway provides Claude Code with the same development capabilities and tools that are available in this 
  environment! 🚀

  Missing (current issues):
  - NO AGENT for RLS policy violations
  - NO AGENT for user profile creation failures
  - NO AGENT for storage authentication errors

  🚨 Why No Agents Are Responding

  Pattern Recognition Gap:
  The monitoring system only detects:
  - Build errors ✅
  - Server startup failures ✅
  - HTTP-level errors ✅
  - Missing: Database runtime errors ❌

  Current Patterns Don't Include:
  // These patterns are MISSING from the monitoring system:
  /RLS.*policy.*violation/i          // ← Current database issue
  /user.*profile.*not found/i        // ← Current profile issue  
  /storage.*upload.*failed/i         // ← Current avatar issue
  /supabase.*error/i                 // ← General database errors

  💡 The Problem

  Your monitoring agents are working perfectly for what they were designed to detect (build/server issues), but they're blind to the
  current database problems because:

  1. Log Source: Monitoring focuses on build/server logs, not runtime API errors
  2. Pattern Matching: No database-specific error patterns configured
  3. Scope: Designed for dev server monitoring, not production runtime issues

  🎯 Bottom Line

  No agents have been deployed for the current database issues because the monitoring system doesn't recognize these as "issues" - it's a
  monitoring coverage gap, not an agent failure.

  The RLS policy violations and storage auth failures are happening at the application level but aren't being captured by the
  build/server-focused monitoring patterns.

  - HTTP availability: 100%
  - Process stability: No crashes

  Database Performance: ❌ BLOCKED
  - Profile creation success rate: 0%
  - Avatar upload success rate: 0% (primary), 100% (fallback)
  - Authentication success rate: 100% (Clerk), 0% (Supabase operations)

  🎯 Summary

  System State: Production server running perfectly at HTTP level. Comprehensive monitoring system successfully completed its
  demonstration phase. However, there's a critical database permission crisis affecting user onboarding that the monitoring agents cannot
  detect due to pattern recognition limitations.

  Key Issue: The monitoring agents were designed for build/deployment issues and are not equipped to handle runtime database permission
  problems. Users can authenticate with Clerk but cannot create profiles or upload avatars due to Supabase RLS policy violations.

  Immediate Need: Database configuration fix for RLS policies, not monitoring system enhancement.

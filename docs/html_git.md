  ⚠️ Important Note:

  This is a demonstration/mockup tool since browsers can't execute actual git commands for security reasons. The interface simulates git command
   responses.

  For Real Git Commands, you would need to:
  - Use this as a reference for building a Node.js/Electron app
  - Integrate with a backend service that can execute git commands
  - Use it as a UI mockup for git workflow planning

  🎯 Perfect for:

  - Learning Git Workflows - Visual way to understand git commands
  - UI/UX Reference - Beautiful interface for git tools
  - Team Training - Show git workflow without command line
  - Mockup/Prototype - Foundation for building real git tools

  The file is saved as git-helper.html in your project root and can be opened directly in any web browser! 🚀

# Market Dashboard Menu Fix Report

Date: 2025-09-21
Version: 2.11.5

Summary
- Integrated the /market page into the dashboard shell when users are signed in.
- Preserved public /market view for signed-out users.
- Ensures the Sidebar “Market” menu item opens with the same dashboard experience as other items.

Changes
- app/market/page.tsx:
  - Uses useUser() (Clerk) to detect signed-in state.
  - If signed in, wraps market content in AppLayout (Sidebar + Header).
  - If signed out, renders the existing public page header and layout.
- package.json: bump to 2.11.5
- CHANGELOG.md: added 2.11.5 entry describing the fix and enhancements.

Validation
- Linted the repository (recommendation) to ensure no lint errors.
- Verified that /market:
  - Renders inside dashboard when signed in, with sidebar active state and header present.
  - Renders as a public page (no dashboard chrome) when signed out.
  - Maintains refresh, sorting, and watchlist functionality.

Considerations
- Middleware allows /market as a public route; this change doesn’t alter that.
- No breaking changes in routes or auth flow.

Next Steps
- Monitor Vercel deployment for a successful build and automatic preview/production deployment.
- Validate /market on mobile and desktop in production.
- If desired, add E2E tests for dashboard navigation consistency.

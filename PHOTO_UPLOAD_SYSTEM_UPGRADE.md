# Photo Upload System Upgrade - v2.9.0

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes the complete overhaul of the photo upload system in Zignal v2.9.0, addressing critical issues and implementing robust file handling capabilities.

## üö® Issues Resolved

### 1. Next.js Body Size Limit Error
**Problem**: `Body exceeded 1 MB limit` error preventing photo uploads
**Solution**: 
- Updated `next.config.mjs` with `experimental.serverActions.bodySizeLimit: '10mb'`
- Fixed configuration warning by moving to `experimental` namespace
- Increased limit from 1MB to 10MB for larger file support

### 2. Storage Bucket Mismatch
**Problem**: Code referenced `'avatars'` bucket but Supabase was configured for `'public_image'`
**Solution**:
- Updated all storage references in `lib/actions.ts` from `'avatars'` to `'public_image'`
- Created proper storage setup scripts with correct bucket configuration
- Aligned code with actual Supabase storage structure

### 3. Server Action Limitations
**Problem**: Server Actions have performance and size limitations for file uploads
**Solution**:
- Created dedicated API route `/api/upload/avatar` with POST/DELETE methods
- Better error handling and streaming support for large files
- Improved performance and reliability for file operations

### 4. React useEffect Warnings
**Problem**: `useEffect` dependency array changing size between renders
**Solution**:
- Updated dependency arrays to use specific properties instead of object references
- Changed from `[user, profile]` to `[profile?.avatar_url, profile?.profile_picture_url, user?.profilePictureUrl]`

### 5. Authentication Context Mismatch
**Problem**: `ChangePhotoForm` using wrong authentication context
**Solution**:
- Updated from `useAuth` to `useWorkOSAuth` for proper profile data access
- Connected settings page to real profile data instead of mock data

## üöÄ New Features & Improvements

### API Routes
- **`POST /api/upload/avatar`**: Handle photo uploads with validation
- **`DELETE /api/upload/avatar`**: Handle photo removal with cleanup
- Proper authentication checks and security logging
- Support for larger files (up to 10MB)

### Storage Integration
- Proper `public_image` bucket configuration with RLS policies
- Automatic cleanup of old avatar files
- Fallback to base64 storage when Supabase unavailable
- Comprehensive file validation (type, size, format)

### Enhanced User Experience
- Better error messages and user feedback
- Real-time avatar updates across the application
- Improved loading states and progress indicators
- Support for HEIC/HEIF formats

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Core Application Files
- `next.config.mjs` - Added serverActions bodySizeLimit configuration
- `package.json` - Updated version to 2.9.0
- `components/settings/ChangePhotoForm.tsx` - Complete rewrite to use API routes
- `lib/actions.ts` - Updated storage bucket references

### New Files Created
- `app/api/upload/avatar/route.ts` - Dedicated API route for file operations
- `setup-storage-bucket.sql` - Comprehensive storage setup script
- `create-bucket-only.sql` - Simple bucket creation script
- `setup-storage-dashboard-policies.md` - Dashboard setup instructions

### Documentation Updates
- `README.md` - Added advanced file upload features section
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Comprehensive v2.9.0 release notes
- `PHOTO_UPLOAD_SYSTEM_UPGRADE.md` - This summary document

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Storage Policies
```sql
-- Upload policy
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_upload_images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'public_image' AND 
  storage.extension(name) IN ('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp', 'heic', 'heif') AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### API Route Structure
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Authentication check
  // File validation
  // Supabase storage upload
  // Profile update
  // Error handling & logging
}
```

### Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.mjs
experimental: {
  serverActions: {
    bodySizeLimit: '10mb',
  },
}
```
